description:
  short: Synapse is a homeserver for the Matrix protocol, and Element is a Matrix client
  long: Synapse is the reference implementation of the Matrix protocol, a next-generation, federated messaging protocol (see matrix.org for details). Element is a Matrix client, bundled with Synapse as part of this release and served as a web application. Matrix is a federated network, meaning that users are registered with Matrix homeservers, which then share user/conversation data with other homeservers as users on different servers interact with each other. Thus, there is no central server for the Matrix protocol.
